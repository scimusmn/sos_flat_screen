# Science on a Sphere<br>Flat screen / Wall projection system

## Usage
This system is installed in the Future Earth Theater on a Windows 7 PC.
It provides ancilary graphics for all of the Science on a Sphere presentations in the theater space.

Although we are sharing this code publically, it's unlikely that this system will be immediately useful for your specific SOS installation without considerable customization. We hope to make a more general purpose tool in the future.

## Tech
This is a HTML5 web application using various JavaScript libraries to play audio,
display images, and play video on our wall projection system.

### Node.JS and Socket.IO
We recently disconued use of Node.JS and Socket.IO in favor or simulated keyboard controls. The Node code is still in place, but commented out and buggy. We will re-enable this once we have an opportunity to do some more testing.
